# Cocktail Books Integration Plan

## Why Books Are Better Than TheCocktailDB

### Problems with Current Data (TheCocktailDB)
1. **Quality varies** - Mix of professional and amateur recipes
2. **No expert validation** - No ratings or classifications
3. **Limited context** - Missing flavor notes, techniques
4. **Measurement inconsistencies** - "1 shot" vs "1.5 oz" confusion
5. **Tomato juice bias** - Algorithm finds gaps in savory dimension

### What Books Provide
1. **Expert-curated recipes** - Tested and refined by professionals
2. **Quality ratings** - Classic/modern, difficulty levels
3. **Flavor descriptions** - "bright", "balanced", "spirit-forward"
4. **Proper techniques** - Shaken vs stirred, garnishes
5. **Recipe variations** - How to adjust for taste preferences
6. **Historical context** - Original vs modern versions

## How We'll Use Your Books

### Step 1: Data Extraction

**Manual Entry Template:**
```json
{
  "source_book": "Death & Co",
  "page": 142,
  "name": "Penicillin",
  "author": "Sam Ross",
  "classification": "modern classic",
  "rating": "5/5",
  "flavor_profile": "smoky, sweet, sour, spicy",
  "technique": "shaken, double-strained",
  "glass": "rocks",
  "ingredients": [
    {"name": "blended scotch", "amount": 60, "unit": "ml"},
    {"name": "lemon juice", "amount": 22.5, "unit": "ml"},
    {"name": "honey-ginger syrup", "amount": 22.5, "unit": "ml"},
    {"name": "islay scotch", "amount": "float", "unit": "ml"}
  ],
  "garnish": "candied ginger",
  "notes": "Balance of smoke, sweet, and heat",
  "expert_validated": true
}
```

**Or Image/Photo Upload:**
```python
# If you have photos of pages
from PIL import Image
import pytesseract

def extract_from_book_photo(image_path):
    """Extract recipe from book photo using OCR."""
    # OCR + parsing logic
    pass
```

### Step 2: Quality Enhancement

**Add Expert Annotations:**
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Classics (e.g., Negroni, Manhattan)
- üî• Modern innovations (e.g., Penicillin)
- üéØ Perfect balance examples
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Advanced techniques required

**Flavor Descriptions:**
- Map book descriptions ‚Üí molecular dimensions
- "bright and citrusy" ‚Üí high sour, aromatic
- "spirit-forward" ‚Üí high base spirit, low sweet
- "well-balanced" ‚Üí TARGET for calibration

### Step 3: Calibration from Experts

**Learn What "Perfect" Means:**
```python
# Analyze 5-star rated cocktails from books
expert_cocktails = load_book_recipes(rating="5/5")

for cocktail in expert_cocktails:
    analysis = analyzer.analyze_cocktail(cocktail)

    # These are EXPERT-VALIDATED as perfect
    ideal_profiles.append(analysis['balance_scores'])

# Compute "ideal" ranges
ideal_balance_target = np.mean([c['overall_balance'] for c in expert_cocktails])
ideal_sweet_range = (0.4, 0.7)  # From expert data
ideal_sour_range = (0.3, 0.6)
# etc.
```

### Step 4: Fix Recommendation Diversity

**Problem**: Too much tomato juice (9/10 recommendations)

**Solution with Book Data**:
```python
# Add "plausibility" score from book frequency
ingredient_frequency = {
    'lemon juice': 847,  # Appears in 847 book recipes
    'simple syrup': 623,
    'lime juice': 512,
    'bitters': 401,
    'tomato juice': 12,  # Rarely used in cocktails!
}

def calculate_plausibility(ingredient, cocktail_style):
    """Weight by how common ingredient is in similar cocktails."""
    frequency = ingredient_frequency.get(ingredient, 0)
    return np.log(frequency + 1) / np.log(max(ingredient_frequency.values()))
```

### Step 5: Recipe Variations

**Learn Adjustment Patterns:**
```python
# Example: Book shows 3 variations of Daiquiri
variations = [
    {"name": "Classic Daiquiri", "rum": 60, "lime": 22, "sugar": 15},
    {"name": "Hemingway Daiquiri", "rum": 60, "lime": 22, "sugar": 0, "grapefruit": 15, "maraschino": 7.5},
    {"name": "Banana Daiquiri", "rum": 60, "lime": 22, "sugar": 15, "banana liqueur": 15}
]

# Learn: "Want it less sweet? Remove sugar, add grapefruit"
# Learn: "Want fruit flavor? Add matching liqueur"
```

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Manual Entry (Immediate)

**Create data entry tool:**
```python
# src/data/book_entry.py
class BookRecipeEntry:
    """Interactive tool to enter recipes from books."""

    def add_recipe(self):
        name = input("Cocktail name: ")
        book = input("Source book: ")
        # ... guided entry

        recipe = self.validate_and_save(data)
        print(f"Added {name} to book_cocktails.json")
```

**Priority books to enter** (your suggestions?):
- Death & Co?
- Cocktail Codex?
- Liquid Intelligence?
- PDT Cocktail Book?
- Others you have?

### Phase 2: OCR/Photo Upload (If Helpful)

If you have many books, we can:
```bash
# Take photos of recipe pages
# Use OCR to extract text
# Parse into structured format
python extract_recipes_from_photos.py --book "Death & Co" --pages photos/*.jpg
```

### Phase 3: Analysis & Calibration

```python
# Compare database vs book cocktails
db_balance_avg = 0.955  # Current average
book_balance_avg = ???  # From your books

# Identify gaps
missing_styles = ["tiki", "molecular", "vintage"]
underrepresented = ["mezcal cocktails", "sherry cocktails"]
```

### Phase 4: Improved Recommendations

```python
class OptimizerV4(OptimizerV3):
    """
    Enhanced with book knowledge:
    - Plausibility scoring
    - Style-aware recommendations
    - Expert balance targets
    """

    def recommend_with_book_knowledge(self, cocktail):
        candidates = self.generate_candidates(cocktail)

        # NEW: Score by book frequency
        for cand in candidates:
            cand['plausibility'] = self.book_frequency[cand['ingredient']]
            cand['style_match'] = self.matches_style(cocktail, cand)

        # Rank by improvement * plausibility
        ranked = sorted(candidates,
                       key=lambda c: c['improvement'] * c['plausibility'],
                       reverse=True)

        return ranked[0]
```

## What You Can Do Now

### Option 1: Manual Entry (Start Small)
Pick **10 favorite cocktails** from your books:
- 5 classics you consider "perfectly balanced"
- 5 modern favorites

I'll create an entry form for you.

### Option 2: Bulk Photo Upload
If you have many recipes:
- Take photos of pages
- Send folder of images
- I'll build OCR extraction

### Option 3: Guided Entry Session
We go through books together:
