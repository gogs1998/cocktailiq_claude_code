## Progress Monitoring

### How to Check Progress

**View log file:**
```bash
tail -20 data/scraper_log.txt
```

**Check recipes scraped:**
```bash
python -c "
import json
with open('data/book_cocktails.json', 'r') as f:
    recipes = json.load(f)
print(f'Recipes scraped: {len(recipes)}')
"
```

**Check checkpoint:**
```bash
python -c "
import json
with open('data/scraper_checkpoint.json', 'r') as f:
    checkpoint = json.load(f)
print(f'Scraped: {checkpoint[\"scraped_count\"]} recipes')
print(f'Last update: {checkpoint[\"last_update\"]}')
"
```

### Checkpoints

Every 100 recipes, the scraper:
1. Saves all scraped recipes to `data/book_cocktails.json`
2. Updates checkpoint in `data/scraper_checkpoint.json`
3. Logs progress to `data/scraper_log.txt`

**If interrupted:** Restart with `python scrape_diffords_bulk.py` and it will resume from last checkpoint!
